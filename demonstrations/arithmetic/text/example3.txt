Which number do you have to write in the last daisy? 

Answer: 61

Let's think this step by step: Let's solve the problem step by step by applying the given operations between the numbers:

- Start with \( 48 \).
- Subtract 20: \( 48 - 20 = 28 \).
- Add 9: \( 28 + 9 = 37 \).
- Subtract 6: \( 37 - 6 = 31 \).
- Add 30: \( 31 + 30 = 61 \).

### Final Answer:
The number you should write in the last daisy is **61**.
