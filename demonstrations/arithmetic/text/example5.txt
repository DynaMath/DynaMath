How many plums (see the picture) weigh as much as an apple?

Answer: 3

Let's think this step by step: 
### Left Side:
- 3 apples
- 2 plums

### Right Side:
- 1 apple
- 8 plums

Since the scale is balanced, the total weight on the left side equals the total weight on the right side.

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. Let the weight of one apple be \( A \), and the weight of one plum be \( P \).

2. The total weight on the **left side** of the scale:
   \[
   3A + 2P.
   \]

3. The total weight on the **right side** of the scale:
   \[
   A + 8P.
   \]

Since the scale is balanced, we can set the two expressions equal to each other:
\[
3A + 2P = A + 8P.
\]

### Solving for \( A \) in terms of \( P \):

1. Subtract \( A \) from both sides:
   \[
   2A + 2P = 8P.
   \]

2. Subtract \( 2P \) from both sides:
   \[
   2A = 6P.
   \]

3. Divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   A = 3P.
   \]

### Final Answer:
One apple weighs as much as **3 plums**.
