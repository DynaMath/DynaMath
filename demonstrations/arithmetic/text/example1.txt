Which number should be written in place of the question mark? 

Answer: 60

Let's think this step by step: To find the missing number in the sequence, let's analyze the pattern in the numbers on the train:

- The numbers on the train are: \( 90, 80, 70, \, ?, \, 50, 40, 30, 20 \).

This is an arithmetic sequence where the difference between consecutive numbers is \( -10 \). Each number is decreasing by 10.

### Pattern:
- \( 90 - 10 = 80 \)
- \( 80 - 10 = 70 \)
- \( 70 - 10 = 60 \) (missing number)
- \( 60 - 10 = 50 \)
- \( 50 - 10 = 40 \)
- \( 40 - 10 = 30 \)
- \( 30 - 10 = 20 \)

### Conclusion:
The number that should replace the question mark is **60**.
