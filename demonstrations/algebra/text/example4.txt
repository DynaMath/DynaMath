The two markers with a question mark have the same number. Which number do you have to put instead of the question mark so that the calculation is correct?

Answer: 3

Let's think this step by step: To solve the problem:

The equation is:
\[ 10 + ? + ? + 2 = 18 \]

Where both question marks represent the same number. Let's denote the number as \( x \). The equation becomes:
\[ 10 + x + x + 2 = 18 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 12 + 2x = 18 \]

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[ 2x = 18 - 12 \]
\[ 2x = 6 \]
\[ x = 3 \]

So, each question mark should be replaced with **3** to satisfy the equation.
