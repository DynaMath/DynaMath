A sandwich and a juice cost 12 Euros together. A sandwich and two juices cost 14 Euros together. How many Euros does one juice cost?

Answer: 2

Let's think this step by step: To solve this problem, we'll set up two equations based on the information given.

Let:
- \( S \) = cost of one sandwich (in Euros)
- \( J \) = cost of one juice (in Euros)

**From the first statement:**

1. *A sandwich and a juice cost 12 Euros together:*
   \[
   S + J = 12 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
   \]

**From the second statement:**

2. *A sandwich and two juices cost 14 Euros together:*
   \[
   S + 2J = 14 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
   \]

**To find the cost of one juice (\( J \)), follow these steps:**

**Step 1: Subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2 to eliminate \( S \):**

\[
(S + 2J) - (S + J) = 14 - 12
\]
\[
S + 2J - S - J = 2
\]
\[
J = 2
\]

**Step 2: Conclude the cost of one juice:**

- One juice costs **2 Euros**.
