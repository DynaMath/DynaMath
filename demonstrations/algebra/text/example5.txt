Maria has a total of 19 apples in 3 bags. She takes the same amount of apples from each bag. Then there are 3, 4 and 6 apples in the bags. <image1> How many apples did Maria take from each bag?

Answer: 2

Let's think this step by step: Maria had a total of 19 apples distributed among 3 bags. After taking the same number of apples from each bag, the remaining apples are 3, 4, and 6 in the respective bags.

Letâ€™s denote the number of apples Maria took from each bag as \( x \). Then the initial number of apples in the bags were:
- In the first bag: \( 3 + x \),
- In the second bag: \( 4 + x \),
- In the third bag: \( 6 + x \).

The total number of apples in the bags before Maria took any out was 19. Therefore, the equation becomes:

\[
(3 + x) + (4 + x) + (6 + x) = 19
\]

Simplifying this equation:

\[
3 + 4 + 6 + 3x = 19
\]
\[
13 + 3x = 19
\]
\[
3x = 19 - 13
\]
\[
3x = 6
\]
\[
x = 2
\]

Thus, Maria took **2 apples** from each bag.
