Which patterned block goes in the fourth spot? Please choose from A, B, C, or D in the figure.

Answer: (A)

To solve this pattern puzzle, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Top row of the grid**:
   - The first and second images on the top row show a pattern of 2x2 blocks with four colors (blue, yellow, green, and red).
   - The first grid rotates 90 degrees clockwise to form the second grid. The upper left block (blue) rotates to the upper right, the upper right block (yellow) rotates to the bottom right, and so on.

2. **Bottom row of the grid**:
   - The third image (empty) likely follows the same pattern but we need to find which one of the options fits the expected rotation.
   - Since the second image was a 90-degree clockwise rotation of the first, the next rotation would be another 90-degree clockwise turn.

3. **Identify the pattern of rotation**:
   - Continuing the rotation pattern, the red block should move from the bottom left to the upper left, the green from bottom right to upper right, the blue from top right to bottom right, and the yellow from top left to bottom left.

4. **Compare with the options**:
   - Option **A** has the correct rotation with red in the top left, green in the top right, blue in the bottom right, and yellow in the bottom left.

Thus, the correct block that fits the fourth spot is **A**.
