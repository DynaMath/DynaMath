Please determine the total weight in the fourth image.

Answer: 27

To solve the puzzle and determine the total weight in the fourth image, let's break it down based on the given weights:

1. **First image**: A frog and a sheep together weigh **10 kg**.
2. **Second image**: A horse and a frog together weigh **20 kg**.
3. **Third image**: A horse and a sheep together weigh **24 kg**.

We can now set up three equations to represent these situations:
- Frog + Sheep = 10 kg (Equation 1)
- Horse + Frog = 20 kg (Equation 2)
- Horse + Sheep = 24 kg (Equation 3)

### Solving the system of equations:
1. From Equation 2, we can express the weight of the horse:
   - Horse = 20 kg - Frog (from Equation 2).

2. Substitute Horse in Equation 3:
   - (20 kg - Frog) + Sheep = 24 kg.
   - 20 kg - Frog + Sheep = 24 kg.
   - Sheep - Frog = 4 kg (Equation 4).

3. Now use Equation 1 (Frog + Sheep = 10 kg) and Equation 4 (Sheep - Frog = 4 kg):
   - Adding these two equations:
     (Frog + Sheep) + (Sheep - Frog) = 10 kg + 4 kg,
     gives:
     2 Ã— Sheep = 14 kg,
     so Sheep = 7 kg.

4. Substitute the value of Sheep (7 kg) into Equation 1:
   - Frog + 7 kg = 10 kg,
     so Frog = 3 kg.

5. Finally, substitute the value of Frog (3 kg) into Equation 2:
   - Horse + 3 kg = 20 kg,
     so Horse = 17 kg.

### Total weight in the fourth image:
- The fourth image has the horse, the sheep, and the frog together.
- The total weight is:
  Horse (17 kg) + Sheep (7 kg) + Frog (3 kg) = **27 kg**.

Thus, the total weight in the fourth image is **27 kg**.
