In this visual brainteaser, you can see three glasses on the left that are full and three on the right that are empty.
If you can make one small change, you can make a row of alternately full and empty glasses, but you can only do one change.
What do you have to do?

Answer: To achieve alternating full and empty glasses with only one change, you can follow this simple step:

1. Take the second glass from the left (which is full) and pour its contents into the second glass from the right (which is empty).

This way, the glasses will alternate between full and empty as follows:
- First glass: full
- Second glass: empty (after pouring the contents)
- Third glass: full
- Fourth glass: empty
- Fifth glass: full
- Sixth glass: empty

Thus, you will have achieved the alternating pattern with just one change.
