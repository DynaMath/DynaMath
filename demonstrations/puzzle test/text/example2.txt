How many blocks are in this 3D tower?

Answer: 9

To determine how many blocks are in this 3D tower, let's count them step by step by visualizing each layer and block:

1. **Bottom layer** (the base):
   - There are 2 visible blocks on the bottom layer, and 3 more invisible blocks hidden blow the midder layer.

2. **Middle layer**:
   - There are 3 blocks on the second layer. Two of these are stacked directly on top of the bottom layer, and one extends further outward.

3. **Top layer**:
   - There are 1 blocks on the top layer, stacked directly on blocks in the middle layer.

### Total:
- Bottom layer: 2+3=5 blocks
- Middle layer: 3 blocks
- Top layer: 1 blocks

Thus, the total number of blocks is **9**.
