What is the sum of the points on the invisible faces of the dice? 

Answer: 27

Let's think this step by step: Each die has 6 faces, and the numbers on a standard die are \( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 \). The total sum of the numbers on all faces of one die is:

\[
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21.
\]

Since there are **two dice**, the total sum of the numbers on all faces of both dice is:

\[
21 + 21 = 42.
\]

### Visible Numbers:
From your input, the visible numbers are:
- \( 1, 2, 4, 6, 2 \).

The total sum of the visible numbers is:

\[
1 + 2 + 4 + 6 + 2 = 15.
\]

### Sum of the Invisible Faces:
Now, subtract the sum of the visible numbers from the total sum of all faces:

\[
42 - 15 = 27.
\]

### Final Answer:
The sum of the points on the invisible faces of the dice is **27**.

Final answer: **27**.
