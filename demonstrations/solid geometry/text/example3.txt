The construction in the picture is built of cubes of the same size and weighs 189 grams. How many grams does one cube weigh?

Answer: 21

Let's think this step by step: To determine how many grams one cube weighs, we first need to count the total number of cubes in the structure.

Looking at the image:

- There are two layers.
- In the top layer, there are 3 cubes.
- In the bottom layer, there are 6 cubes.

Thus, the total number of cubes is:
\[
3 \text{ (top layer)} + 6 \text{ (bottom layer)} = 9 \text{ cubes}.
\]

The total weight of the structure is 189 grams. To find the weight of one cube, we divide the total weight by the number of cubes:

\[
\frac{189 \text{ grams}}{9 \text{ cubes}} = 21 \text{ grams per cube}.
\]

### Final Answer:
Each cube weighs **21 grams**.
