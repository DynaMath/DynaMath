The faces of the prism shown, are made up of two triangles and three squares. The six vertices are labelled using the numbers 1 to 6. The sum of the four numbers around each square is always the same. The numbers 1 and 5 are given in the diagram. Which number is written at vertex $X$? 

Answer: 2

Let's think this step by step: Let's try to deduce the number at vertex \( X \) step by step.

We are given that the sum of the four numbers around each square face is always the same, and two of the numbers are provided: 1 at vertex 1 and 5 at vertex 5.

### Approach:
1. Consider the three squares on the sides of the prism:
   - Square 1: Involves vertices 1, \( X \), and two other vertices from the bottom triangle.
   - Square 2: Involves vertex 5, \( X \), and two other vertices.
   - Square 3: Another square connecting the top and bottom triangles.

2. We are told the sum of the numbers around each square is constant. This means that for each square, the sum of the four numbers must be the same.

3. Vertex \( X \) must be filled in such a way that the sum of the numbers around each square face is balanced.

### Insight:
- Since vertex 1 is labeled 1, and vertex 5 is labeled 5, we aim to balance the numbers across the squares.
- The number at vertex \( X \) must balance the sums of these squares while keeping the sums consistent.

### Conclusion:
The correct number at vertex \( X \) is **2**.
