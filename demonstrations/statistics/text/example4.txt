How many groups of bars contain at least one bar with value greater than 8?

Answer: 4

Let's think this step by step: 
From the bar chart, let's check each group of bars to see if at least one bar in the group has a value greater than 8:

1. **Bee**: The blue bar (thesis) is greater than 8.
2. **Summit**: No bar exceeds 8.
3. **Gloom**: The orange bar (import) is greater than 8.
4. **Urge**: No bar exceeds 8.
5. **Quack**: No bar exceeds 8.
6. **Stove**: Both bars (thesis and import) are greater than 8.
7. **Usage**: The orange bar (import) is greater than 8.

Thus, the groups that contain at least one bar with a value greater than 8 are:
- Bee
- Gloom
- Stove
- Usage

There are **4 groups** where at least one bar has a value greater than 8.

The correct option is **4**.
