What is the sum of accuracies of the algorithm border for all the datasets?	

Answer: 23

Let's think this step by step: To find the sum of the accuracies for the "border" algorithm across all datasets (map, crack, and flower), let's read the values from the bar chart:

- **Map (blue)**: The accuracy is 5.
- **Crack (orange)**: The accuracy is 9.
- **Flower (green)**: The accuracy is 9.

Now, sum these values:

\[
5 + 9 + 9 = 23
\]

Thus, the sum of the accuracies for the "border" algorithm across all datasets is **23**.
