What is the sum of woman widowed and divorced or separated?

Answer: 306

Let's think this step by step: From the bar chart:

- The number of **widowed women** is 186.
- The number of **divorced or separated women** is 120.

The sum is:

\[
186 + 120 = 306
\]

Thus, the sum of widowed and divorced or separated women is **306**.

The correct option is **306**.
