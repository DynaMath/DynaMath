Hanni wants to colour in the circles in the diagram. When two circles are connected by a line they should have different colours. What is the minimum number of colours she needs?

Answer: 3

Let's think this step by step: The diagram you provided appears to be a graph where each node (circle) needs to be colored such that no two adjacent nodes (connected by a line) have the same color. This is a classic example of a graph coloring problem.

To determine the minimum number of colors needed (also known as the chromatic number of the graph), we need to analyze the structure of the graph.

From the visual:

- The graph is a bipartite-like structure where the center node connects to all other nodes. 
- Each node on the left and right sides of the graph does not connect directly to each other but through the center.

Since no two adjacent nodes should share the same color, the minimum number of colors Hanni needs is **3**. Here's the reasoning:
- The two outer layers of nodes (left and right) can each be colored with the same two alternating colors (since they're not connected to each other).
- The center node needs a third distinct color because it's connected to all other nodes.

Thus, the minimum number of colors needed to satisfy the condition is **3**.
