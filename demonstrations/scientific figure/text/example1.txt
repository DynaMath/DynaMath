If the population of the red squirrels increased, what would happen to the amount of pine available?
(A) The amount of pine available would remain the same.
(B) The amount of pine available would decrease.
(C) The amount of pine available would double.
(D) The amount of pine available would increase.

Answer: (B)

Let's think this step by step: In the food web of Isle Royale National Park, the red squirrels are primary consumers that feed on pine, which is a primary producer.

If the population of red squirrels increases, the consumption of pine would increase because more squirrels would be feeding on it. As a result, the amount of pine available would decrease.

**Conclusion:** If the population of red squirrels increased, the amount of pine available would **decrease**.

Thus, the correct option is \( B \).
