Please answer the question requiring an integer answer and provide the final value, e.g., 1, 2, 3, at the end. Question: What is the limit of f(x) when x -> inf?

Answer: 0

Let's think this step by step: The function shown in the plot is \( g(x) = 0.5^x \). Let's reconsider the limit:

As \( x \to -\infty \), the function \( 0.5^x \) increases because raising 0.5 to a very negative power results in large values. 

Conversely, as \( x \to \infty \), \( 0.5^x \) approaches 0 since the base is a fraction less than 1.

The limit when \( x \to -\infty \) is \( \infty \), but for the limit as \( x \to \infty \):

\[
\lim_{{x \to \infty}} 0.5^x = 0.
\]

The final integer answer for the limit when \( x \to +\infty \) is: **0**.

The number that was not used is **0**.
