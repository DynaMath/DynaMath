Please answer the question and provide the correct option letter, e.g., A, B, C, D, at the end. Question: The derivative of f(x) at x=-2 is ____ that at x=2 Choices: (A) larger than (B) equal to (C) smaller than

Answer: (B)

Let's think this step by step: Looking closely at the graph, we can see that the function appears to be symmetric around the origin, which is typical for a sigmoid function. This symmetry implies that the rate of change (slope or derivative) at \( x = -2 \) and \( x = 2 \) should be the same in magnitude, though the direction (sign) of the slope might be different.

Given the symmetry, the derivative at \( x = -2 \) is equal to that at \( x = 2 \), though one will be negative and the other positive. The magnitude of the derivatives is the same.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**(B) equal to**.

Therefore, the correct option is **B**.
