Please answer the question requiring an integer answer and provide the final value, e.g., 1, 2, 3, at the end. Question: What is the limit of the green function as x approaches negative infinity?

Answer: 0

Let's think this step by step: The graph shown represents the function \( y = \frac{1}{x} \), which is a typical example of a hyperbola.

As \( x \to -\infty \), the function \( y = \frac{1}{x} \) approaches 0 from the negative side. This means that the function becomes closer and closer to 0, but remains negative as \( x \) decreases towards negative infinity.

Thus, the limit of the green function as \( x \to -\infty \) is 0.

Final answer: **0**.
