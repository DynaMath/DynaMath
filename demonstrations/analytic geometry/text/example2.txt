Please answer the question and provide the correct option letter, e.g., A, B, C, D, at the end. Question: Is this an even function? Choices: (A) Yes (B) No

Answer: (A)

Let's think this step by step: The function shown in the graph is \( y = \text{sech}(x) \). The hyperbolic secant function \( \text{sech}(x) \) is defined as:

\[
\text{sech}(x) = \frac{2}{e^x + e^{-x}}.
\]

It is symmetric around the y-axis, meaning that \( \text{sech}(-x) = \text{sech}(x) \), which is the definition of an even function.

Therefore, the answer is:

**(A) Yes**.

Therefore, the correct option is **A**.
