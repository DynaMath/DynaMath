Please answer the question and provide the correct option letter, e.g., A, B, C, D, at the end. Question: is the function periodic? Choices: (A) Yes (B) No

Answer: (A)

Let's think this step by step: The function shown in the graph is \( f(x) = 5 \sin(x) \).

The sine function \( \sin(x) \) is a well-known periodic function, and multiplying it by a constant (in this case, 5) does not change its periodic nature. The function \( f(x) = 5 \sin(x) \) repeats its values in regular intervals, specifically with a period of \( 2\pi \).

Therefore, the answer is:

**(A) Yes**.

Therefore, the correct option is **A**.
