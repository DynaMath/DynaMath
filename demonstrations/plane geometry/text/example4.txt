Please answer the question and provide the correct option letter, e.g., A, B, C, D, at the end. Question: Use parallelogram $ABCD$ to find $AD$ 
Choices: (A) 6 (B) 12 (C) 18 (D) 30

Answer: (C)

Let's think this step by step: In parallelogram \( ABCD \), opposite sides are equal. The sides are labeled as follows:
- \( CD = 12 \) units,
- \( BC = 18 \) units.

By the property of parallelograms, the opposite sides are equal. Therefore:
- \( AD = BC \).

Since \( BC = 18 \) units (as labeled in the diagram), it follows that \( AD = 18 \) units as well.

The correct answer is **C**.
