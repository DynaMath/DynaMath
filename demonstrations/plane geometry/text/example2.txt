Please answer the question and provide the correct option letter, e.g., A, B, C, D, at the end. Question: Find the area of the parallelogram. Round to the nearest tenth if necessary. 
Choices: (A) 165 (B) 180 (C) 195 (D) 210

Answer: (B)

Let's think this step by step: From the image:
- The **base** of the parallelogram is given as 15 inches.
- The **height** is not directly provided but must be calculated using the perpendicular distance from the top of the parallelogram to the base. The given distance of 5 inches corresponds to the horizontal difference from where the height line meets the base.

We have a right triangle where:
- The hypotenuse is 13 inches (the slanted side of the parallelogram).
- One leg (horizontal distance) is 5 inches (the offset between the two bases).

To find the height, we can apply the Pythagorean theorem to this right triangle:
\[
\text{Height}^2 + 5^2 = 13^2
\]
\[
\text{Height}^2 + 25 = 169
\]
\[
\text{Height}^2 = 169 - 25 = 144
\]
\[
\text{Height} = \sqrt{144} = 12 \, \text{inches}
\]

Now, we can calculate the area using the correct height:
\[
\text{Area} = \text{base} \times \text{height} = 15 \times 12 = 180 \, \text{square inches}
\]

Thus, the area of the parallelogram is \( 180 \) square inches.

The correct option is **B**.
